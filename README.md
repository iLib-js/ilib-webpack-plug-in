# ilib-webpack-plug-in

ilib-webpack-plug-in is a webpack plugin for ilib so that you can use ilib in your
own webpack project and
only include the ilib classes and locale data that you actually need. It can also be used
to create a custom version of ilib, even if you are not using webpack in your own
project.

To use iLib in your own project, you will need both the ilib-webpack-plug-in and the
ilib-webpack-loader together.

Be careful of the spelling of the repo name -- the enyojs project has named
"ilib-webpack-plugin" which is different and cannot be used with the ilb
loader to build ilib, except if you are building it for Enyo or Enact.

The full documentation for the use of this plugin and the loader together is in the
[ilib-webpack-loader project](http://github.com/ilib-js/ilib-webpack-loader).
