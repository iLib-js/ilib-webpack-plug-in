# ilib-webpack-plugin

ilib-webpack-plugin is a webpack plugin for ilib so that you can use ilib in your
own webpack project and
only include the ilib classes and locale data that you actually need. It can also be used
to create a custom version of ilib, even if you are not using webpack in your own
project.

To use iLib in your own project, you will need both the ilib-webpack-plugin and the 
ilib-webpack-loader together. 

The full documentation for the use of this plugin and the loader together is in the 
[ilib-webpack-loader project](http://github.com/ilib-js/ilib-webpack-loader).
